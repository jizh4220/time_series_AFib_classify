Please provide me a list of top10 most highly citated and active researchers in COPD and all chronic respiratory disease study scientists, you may take into the account of h-index as the primary factors and their overal citations as the second most important factors. Their h-index should not be lower than 70 and their overall citations should no less than 8000. Your search should cross-compare with the google scholar database.
