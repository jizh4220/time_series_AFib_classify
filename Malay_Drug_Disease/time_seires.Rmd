Time-series analysis on your drug-disease dataframe. Total number of drug prescriptions and disease occurrences over time. 

First, let's install and load the necessary libraries:
```r
install.packages(c("dplyr", "ggplot2", "xts", "forecast"))
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(xts)
library(forecast)
```

Next, let's calculate the total number of drug prescriptions and disease occurrences for each month:

```r
# Total number of drug prescriptions each month
drug_time_series <- df %>%
  group_by(month, drug) %>%
  summarise(count = n(), .groups = "drop") %>%
  group_by(month) %>%
  summarise(total = sum(count), .groups = "drop")

# Total number of disease occurrences each month
disease_time_series <- df %>%
  group_by(month, disease) %>%
  summarise(count = n(), .groups = "drop") %>%
  group_by(month) %>%
  summarise(total = sum(count), .groups = "drop")
```

Now, let's visualize the time series data. We'll create line plots for the total number of drug prescriptions and disease occurrences each month:

```r
# Line plot for total number of drug prescriptions each month
ggplot(drug_time_series, aes(x = month, y = total)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Total Number of Drug Prescriptions Each Month", x = "Month", y = "Total")

# Line plot for total number of disease occurrences each month
ggplot(disease_time_series, aes(x = month, y = total)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Total Number of Disease Occurrences Each Month", x = "Month", y = "Total")
```

Finally, let's perform a simple forecasting using the `forecast` package. We'll use the AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model for this:

```r
# Convert the dataframes to time series objects
drug_ts <- xts(drug_time_series$total, order.by = as.Date(drug_time_series$month))
disease_ts <- xts(disease_time_series$total, order.by = as.Date(disease_time_series$month))

# Fit an ARIMA model and forecast the next 12 months
drug_forecast <- forecast(auto.arima(drug_ts), h = 12)
disease_forecast <- forecast(auto.arima(disease_ts), h = 12)

# Plot the forecasts
plot(drug_forecast, main = "Drug Prescription Forecast")
plot(disease_forecast, main = "Disease Occurrence Forecast")
```

This will give you line plots of the total number of drug prescriptions and disease occurrences each month, as well as forecasts for the next 12 months. Remember to replace `df`, `month`, `drug`, and `disease` with your actual dataframe and column names. Also, ensure that the `month` column is in the correct date format for accurate results. If your data is large, this operation may take some time. Let me know if you need help with anything else! ðŸ˜Š
